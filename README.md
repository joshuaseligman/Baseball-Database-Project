# Baseball-Database-Project

The baseball database models important baseball statistics since 2015 and was my final project for my Database Management class. We were tasked with completing the following: designing our own database, creating the tables, populating the tables with data, and writing a wide variety of queries that showcased every aspect of the database.

### Designing the Database
Designing the database required me to consider all of the data that I wanted to represent in the database. Thus, I mapped out an entity relationship diagram that visualized the various entities and their relationships with each other. This helped me obtain a strong sense for the tables that were required to keep the database in third normal form with no partial dependencies or transitive dependencies.

### Creating the Tables and Populating the Database
I used SQL to define each table and their fields, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints. These definitions were crucial to the data population as they kept the database consistent and without any integrity violations. Thus, as I collected the data in the spreadsheets, I made sure to follow these rules to avoid any conflicts or errors.

### Writing the Queries
Creating my own queries was a big challenge because I wanted to show how each table interacts with each other while also making each query relevant to the context of the database. Although some queries were more complex than others, they all served the purpose of generating outputs that would be useful to someone seeking to obtain and analyze information about baseball players and teams.
